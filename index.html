    <h3>The Programming Students Creed</h3>
      <h5>10/21/24</h5>
      <h5>Joshua Ennis</h5>
    <p>This is a code; there are many like it but this one is mine.<br> My code is my best friend. It is my work <br> I must master it as I must master college. <br> Without me my textbooks are useless, without my textbooks, I'm unable to get a job in programming <br> I must use get test answers correct, and demonstrate my knoweledge through assignments more often than our peers. <br> I need to learn new things, before the forces of globalization, big data, and AI render my skillsets usless.<br> My education and myself are the guide of my asperations and we will master these assignments to find properity. </p>
