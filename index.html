    <h3>The Programming Students Creed</h3>
      <h5>10/21/24</h5>
      <h5>Joshua Ennis</h5>
    <p>This is a code; there are many like it but this one is mine.<br> My code is my best friend. It is my work <br> I must master it as I must master college. <br> Without me my textbooks are useless, without my textbooks, I'm unable to get a job in programming <br> I must use get test answers correct, and demonstrate my knoweledge through assignments more often than our peers. <br> I need to learn new things, before the forces of globalization, big data, and AI render my skillsets usless.<br> My education and myself are the guide of my asperations and we will master these assignments to find properity. </p>

    <p>Well, I left home back in '24 <br> and went to work at big ol school, the first year they had me working on the front end, and every day I'd watch that code roll on by <br> and sometimes, I'd bang my head and cry <br> 'Cause I wanted one set that was long and grand. <br> One day I devised myself a plan <br> That should be the envy of most any that can <br> I'd sneak a out some grasp, in a little notepad. <br> now getting caught would mean postgrad but i figured id have it all by the passed, I'd have code worth at least a hundred grand. </p>
    <p>I'd have it one mark at a time<br> And it would cost me quite a dime <br> You'd know it's me when I comb through you're code</p>
