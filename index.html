          <p class="postwriting">This is a code; there are many like it but this one is mine. My code is my best friend. It is my work I must master it as I must master college.  Without me my textbooks are useless, without my textbooks, I'm unable to get a job in programming   I must use get test answers correct, and demonstrate my knoweledge through assignments more often than our peers.   I need to learn new things, before the forces of globalization, big data, and AI render my skillsets usless.  My education and my intellegence are the guide of my asperations and we will master these assignments to find properity.</p>

          <p>Well, I left home back in '24 and went to work at big ol school, the first year they had me working on the front end, and every day I'd watch that code roll on by  and sometimes, I'd bang my head and cry  'Cause I wanted one set that was long and grand.   One day I devised myself a plan   That should be the envy of most any that can   I'd sneak a out some grasp, in a little notepad.   now getting caught would mean postgrad but i figured id have it all by the passed, I'd have code worth at least a hundred grand. I'd have it one mark at a time  And it would cost me quite a dime   You'd know it's me when I comb through you're code</p>
